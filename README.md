#Instructions

In your project, create a `.npmrc` in the same directory as your `package.json`, and then add this line to it

`@chulinguy:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com/`

Then in terminal, install the package via `npm install @chulinguy/chi-nitid-component-libray@1.0.2` (or whatever version you'd like)
